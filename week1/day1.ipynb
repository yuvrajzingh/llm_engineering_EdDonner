Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

       "'Imagine you have a set of Russian nesting dolls.  To figure out how many dolls you have, you can open the first doll.  Inside, you find another, smaller doll.  You open that one.  Inside, you find another, even smaller doll.  You keep doing this until you open a doll and find *nothing* inside.  Then you know you\\'re done.  You can count how many dolls you opened.\\n\\nRecursion is like that!\\n\\n**Here\\'s the breakdown:**\\n\\n* **A recursive function is a function that calls itself.**  Like opening a Russian doll and finding another doll, the function \"calls\" itself to do part of the job.\\n\\n* **There\\'s a \"base case.\"**  This is the condition where the function *stops* calling itself.  Like finding an empty doll, this stops the chain reaction. Without a base case, the function would keep calling itself forever (or until your computer crashes!).\\n\\n* **Each call moves closer to the base case.** Like each doll gets smaller, each time the function calls itself, it\\'s solving a slightly simpler version of the problem.\\n\\n**Think of it as \"divide and conquer,\" but for functions:**\\n\\nInstead of trying to solve the entire problem at once, a recursive function breaks it down into smaller, similar problems until it reaches a problem that is so simple it can be solved directly (the base case).  Then, it puts the solutions to the smaller problems back together to solve the original problem.\\n\\n**Example:  Calculating Factorial (5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)**\\n\\nA recursive function to calculate factorial would work like this:\\n\\n1. **`factorial(5)`:**  \"I need to calculate 5!  That\\'s 5 * 4!.  I\\'ll call `factorial(4)` to find out what 4! is.\"\\n2. **`factorial(4)`:**  \"I need to calculate 4!  That\\'s 4 * 3!.  I\\'ll call `factorial(3)` to find out what 3! is.\"\\n3. **`factorial(3)`:**  \"I need to calculate 3!  That\\'s 3 * 2!.  I\\'ll call `factorial(2)` to find out what 2! is.\"\\n4. **`factorial(2)`:**  \"I need to calculate 2!  That\\'s 2 * 1!.  I\\'ll call `factorial(1)` to find out what 1! is.\"\\n5. **`factorial(1)`:**  \"I need to calculate 1!  That\\'s 1.  I\\'m the base case! I can just return 1.\"\\n6. **`factorial(2)` (resumes):** \"Okay, `factorial(1)` told me 1! is 1.  So 2! is 2 * 1 = 2. I\\'ll return 2.\"\\n7. **`factorial(3)` (resumes):** \"Okay, `factorial(2)` told me 2! is 2.  So 3! is 3 * 2 = 6. I\\'ll return 6.\"\\n8. **`factorial(4)` (resumes):** \"Okay, `factorial(3)` told me 3! is 6.  So 4! is 4 * 6 = 24. I\\'ll return 24.\"\\n9. **`factorial(5)` (resumes):** \"Okay, `factorial(4)` told me 4! is 24.  So 5! is 5 * 24 = 120. I\\'ll return 120.\"\\n\\n**In summary:**\\n\\n* **Recursion: A function calling itself.**\\n* **Base Case:  The condition that stops the recursion.**\\n* **Move Towards Base Case: Each call makes the problem simpler.**\\n\\nRecursion can be elegant and powerful, but it\\'s important to understand the base case to avoid infinite loops. Sometimes an iterative (loop-based) solution is clearer and more efficient.\\n'"
